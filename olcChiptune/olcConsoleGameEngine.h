Hello! Ultimately I don't care what you use this for. It's intended to be
educational, and perhaps to the oddly minded - a little bit of fun.
Please hack this, change it and use it in any way you see fit. You acknowledge
that I am not responsible for anything bad that happens as a result of
your actions. However this code is protected by GNU GPLv3, see the license in the
github repo. This means you must attribute me if you use it. You can view this

Cheers!

Background
~~~~~~~~~~
If you've seen any of my videos - I like to do things using the windows console. It's quick
and easy, and allows you to focus on just the code that matters - ideal when you're
experimenting. Thing is, I have to keep doing the same initialisation and display code
each time, so this class wraps that up.

Usage:
~~~~~~
This class is abstract, so you must inherit from it. Override the OnUserCreate() function
with all the stuff you need for your application (for thready reasons it's best to do
this in this function and not your class constructor). Override the OnUserUpdate(float fElapsedTime)
function with the good stuff, it gives you the elapsed time since the last call so you
can modify your stuff dynamically. Both functions should return true, unless you need
the application to close.

	int main()
	{
		// Use olcConsoleGameEngine derived app
		OneLoneCoder_Example game;

		// Create a console with resolution 160x100 characters
		// Each character occupies 8x8 pixels
		game.ConstructConsole(160, 100, 8, 8);

		// Start the engine!
		game.Start();

		return 0;
	}

Input is also handled for you - interrogate the m_keys[] array with the virtual
keycode you want to know about. bPressed is set for the frame the key is pressed down
in, bHeld is set if the key is held down, bReleased is set for the frame the key
is released in. The same applies to mouse! m_mousePosX and Y can be used to get
the current cursor position, and m_mouse[1..5] returns the mouse buttons.

The draw routines treat characters like pixels. By default they are set to white solid
blocks - but you can draw any unicode character, using any of the colours listed below.

There may be bugs!
